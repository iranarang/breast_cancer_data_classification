# breast_cancer_data_classification

This project analyzes a breast cancer dataset to predict recurrence using machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and a linear classifier. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, with a focus on recall to minimize false negatives.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## Usage

Run the notebook or script to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate performance.
